# Posts from changelog@littleroom.io


## January 2023


Wanted a place where I could log progress on my projects and whatnot, but I didn't want to spin up a whole ass WordPress site in order to do it. Seemed like overkill. Especially if I get bored doing this by mid-February. üòÖ


Decided to give #shuttlecraft a go. Low fuss. Speaks ActivityPub. Single player. Runs on Glitch.

*Q:* What‚Äôs the deal with the domain? Why `littleroom.io`?
*A:* It's a White Stripes reference!

> ‚ÄúWell, you're in your little room and you're working on something good / But if it's really good, you're gonna need a bigger room / And when you're in the bigger room, you might not know what to do / You might have to think of how you got started sitting in your little room‚Äù

Since the goal of this single player instance and account is progress logging, the thought of looking back (‚Äúhow you got started‚Äù) seemed pretty apt.
