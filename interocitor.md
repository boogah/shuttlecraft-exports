Setting up my shuttlecraft.

I’ve got no problem whatsoever being horny on main for Barbara Stanwyck. So that means I can be even hornier on my alt, right? 😈

[@benbrown@social.benbrown.com](https://social.benbrown.com/) When can we start talking about this, BTW?

A few more hours and I'm done with work until January 3rd.


Really looking forward to the 11 days of jack shit that I've got lined up.

The first evening of winter break, I took the number of open tabs on my phone from 500 (a limit on iOS Safari, I guess) to 16.

Feeling like I really missed an opportunity by not picking the username `exeter` for this account.

Rainy day. Sitting on the couch, with a dog curled up in a warm blanket, feet up, luxuriating in reading a book. Slowly.


I really ought to do this more often.

Drinking some wine, waiting for the mushrooms to kick in.

[@boogah@interocitor.parts](https://interocitor.parts/) Tolosa No Oak Chardonnay, BTW. This one was a 2019, but always happy to find a bottle of any vintage.

[@boogah@interocitor.parts](https://interocitor.parts/) Oh, and Hillbilly Cubensis for the mushrooms. Just a 0.3g dose tho.

**Published:** 01-08-23 08:45:28


Took about 0.5g of mushroom chocolate early last night (an APE variant) and ended up with *the worst* stomachache at 3am. Forgot about that fun little psilocybin side effect. Honestly didn't think it'd apply at such a low dose. 😖

That thing where you go stand out in the rain to show your dogs some solidarity so they'll go out to pee, but you're the only one who walks out from under the patio.


So you go back inside completely drenched, and they're all bone dry.

[@boogah@interocitor.parts](https://interocitor.parts/) I was *almost* stuck in meetings until 2:30pm, but I declined one that was an attempted reschedule from today. 😵‍💫

"Oh, fuck right off." — Me, to my calendar after realizing that I'm booked in meetings from 9:15am to 1:20pm tomorrow.

Forgot how long it can take to format a very large hard drive. 😵‍💫

Lifting weights, listening to bell hooks.

**Published:** 01-13-23 16:17:27


No offense to bell hooks, but “How to Blow up a Pipeline” is a way better weightlifting listen.

Shout out to the woman I was just behind with the bumper sticker that read: ✨hot girls hit curbs✨

**Published:** 01-18-23 21:54:32


I am reading **four** different books right now:


* "The Mountain in the Sea" by Ray Nayler
* "All About Love: New Visions" by bell hooks
* "I'm Ok, You're Ok" by Thomas A. Harris
* "How to Blow Up A Pipeline" by Andreas Malm


I really need to up and commit to one and start crossing these off my list, but I'm kind of enjoying bouncing around.

[@boogah@interocitor.parts](https://interocitor.parts/) Two down, two to go.

Testing a thing. Hope I don't break stuff. 😅

Unfortunately, it turns out that Sarah *did not* intend for me to take "your beard smells like truffle cheese" as a compliment. 😞

## February 2023


According to Bookwyrm, I read ten books last month. 😳


Hope I can keep at this pace all year long.

Turns out my body *really* hates doing reps until exhaustion for my last set when I'm lifting weights.


Big oof.

**Published:** 02-01-23 18:22:41


Keep leaving my glasses in the other room and going "I'll grab them the next time I'm up" whenever I realize I've been sitting at my desk, straining my eyes.


This has been going on for ~3 hours now.

Didn't even realize I was in for a 3 day weekend until a couple hours ago. Shoutout to US bank holidays!

**Published:** 02-18-23 01:14:10


When the edible hits but you've still got 3 more hours of work ahead of you. 😅

Really having A DAY today. 🙃

I wish that all the shit would stop rolling downhill for a minute.

Trying to up my protein intake (but not going keto) and it's making me lowkey miserable.

Does anybody ever take that first 5 seconds after you sit down in a car by yourself to have a scream or is it just me? 😬

Juuuuuust waiting for the DNS servers to update at the registrar level before deploying #Postmarks on `unapp.etizi.ng`. 🤫
